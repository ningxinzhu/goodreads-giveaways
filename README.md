# goodreads-giveaways

___Important___: Before running the script, make sure you've entered a giveaway manually _at least once_. The first time involves _setting up a new address_, and the script assumes that it's done. Also, if you have multiple addresses set-up, the script takes the first one. 

## Installation and Set-up

Clone the repo and install the pre-reqs.
```console
sudo git clone https://github.com/SkullTech/goodreads-giveaways.git
sudo apt-get install python3-lxml
cd goodreads-giveaways
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal like the following example.

```console
